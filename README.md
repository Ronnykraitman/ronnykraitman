# Welcome to Ronny's Digital Brain! 🧠✨

Hi! I'm **Ronny**, a **Senior Backend Developer** who loves building cool things with Python and AI.

This repository is more than just code; it's a living interface where you can get to know me, my work, and even have a chat with my AI doppelgänger!

## 🤖 Meet My AI Agent

**Curious about my experience?**

I've built a custom AI agent powered by `gpt-4o-mini` that has read my resume and knows my professional background inside out.

You can ask it things like:
- *"What is Ronny's experience with Python?"*
- *"Tell me about a cool project Ronny worked on."*
- *"Is Ronny open to new opportunities?"*

The agent is designed to be helpful, professional, and maybe a little bit whimsical—just like me!
